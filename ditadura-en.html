			<h2>Concepts:</h2>
				<p>Dictatorship is an regiment where the power is focused in a person or group.</p>

				<p>A dictatorship is characterized by having a censorship,lack of transparent elections, of party freedom and an intense state control in the lives of citizens.</p>
				
				<p>A dictatorship is an undemocratic regime based on the rule of a dictator. To exercise it, the leader relies on only one political party whose ideology will be the only one considered correct and on censorship.</p>

				<p>The dictator is often considered a special person, where citizens owe obedience and it is not possible to question him.</p>

				<p>Dictatorships can be right-wing, left-wing, religious, monarchical, etc. They even use democratic resources such as elections to mask their authoritarian character.</p>
			<h2>Military Dictatorship in Brazil </h2>
				<p>In Brazil, the military regime lasted more than 20 years (between 1964 and 1985). On April 1, 1964, the event known as the 1964 military coup took place.</p>

				<p>The government of President João Goulart (who took over after the resignation of Jânio Quadros) was removed by a coup d'état and the military regime began a few days later. The military occupied the streets on March 31, 1964. After the occupation, President João Goulart decided to take refuge in Uruguay and the next day the military took over the country's government.</p>

				<p>During this period, also known as the “Fifth Brazilian Republic”, the country witnessed the absence of the basic principles of democracy, in addition to censorship and mass political persecution. Several constitutional rights were violated during the Brazilian military dictatorship and countless people who took a stand against the regime were tortured and killed by some of the military.</p>

				<p>The National Congress was dissolved during the military dictatorship, as well as all the political parties, having the right to remain only two: the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) and the National Renewal Alliance (ARENA), which was predominantly formed by the military.</p>
